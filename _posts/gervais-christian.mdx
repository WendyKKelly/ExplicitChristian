## He's Not Not Christian

I just finished my newsletter. [I was drawn to including a video of Ricky Gervais talking about "Write what you know."](https://newsletter.underbel.li)

It occurred to me, again, that Ricky Gervais is one of those atheists I would most like to share a beer with.

He is so Christian.

## Loves Science

He loves science. I listened to his "debate" with Stephen Colbert and was reminded that when he goes all-in about Christianity, he is basically pitting Christianity against Science.

As if having faith in Science is a smart idea. It's not. Science on a pedastle, on an alter, is a dangerous thing.

Religion and science are separate. [The "Big Bang" was theorized by a Jesuit priest.](https://astronomy.com/news/2018/10/the-jesuit-astronomer-who-conceived-of-the-big-bang) 

So...I think it's great that Ricky Gervais loves science. So do I. So do lots of Christians. It has pretty much nothing to do with your faith.

I mean, except I guess that if you are a Christian scientist (not a Christian Scientist) you might use a set of Christian ethics when you work but these are likely to be nearly identical to any good secular humanist's ethics and pretty close to what is required by law.

Mad scientists = Not likely Christian

## Hates Humans 

Okay, first of all, he doesn't.

And niether do Christians. But we share this kind of "Oh my dear Lord — HUMANS!" aesthetic. That thing where you just can't even for one more second about the stuff we humans get up to.

And then a secular human tries to be better and a Christian does too, but knows they can't (really, always) without God's help.

## Why I Sorta Respect Secular Humanists

I literally can't do it without faith. I can't. I could, sometimes, and I have wrestled mightily with God at times to try and do this thing on my own but I always came back.

Now, at 53 years old and honestly dealt a hand that had me by the grace of God running toward my faith so fast and hard, I am finished wrestling. 

So — Ricky Gervais really should consider Christianity. Just a thought for this sunny Monday morning.

Will I continue to call out Christians acting very very poorly? Yes. Will I shun racist Christians? Always. Sexist Christians? Absolutely. 

Will I forgive them? Yes, too. But that's another story. For another day.
