## <a id="One"></a>Day One ##


> John 15:5 CSB
> 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.

### In Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_As I turn toward you this morning, I am aware of both your blinding light and your intense warmth. Both fill me with respect and a sense of safety. I know I am where I am supposed to be._

_A branch on your vine. In your garden._

_Today, let me remember both the obligation and rewards of this placement. When unhelpful, toxic thoughts enter my being, thank you for letting them pass through without taking root. When I notice your sunlight on my face, thank you for gently helping me to turn more fully toward you._

_Amen._

Sometimes the best looking stuff can be the most toxic. "I was only trying to help." Anyone? 

Me, a lot, I think, if I am honest. And yet, like Judas when he tried to persuade Jesus to think that Mary was being wasteful...

What does my heart look like in those moments when I am "helping"? Often, if I am honest, I am full of fear or self serving feelings (that thing where I know what is best for someone, even before I have listened to them).

## <a id="Two"></a>Day Two ##


> Colossians 1:21 - 23 CSB
> 21Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. 22But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him  —  23if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard.

### I Live in Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_I notice that you created all things, through you and for you (Colossians 1:16)._

_You created me and now I live in your garden. In the world, but not of the world (John 17:14 - 15)._

_Today, I live in your garden. Grounded and steadfast in faith in you._

_Amen._

That idea of living in the world but not of the world is a sticky one sometimes.

Maybe it is a mindset, a way of staying grounded and steadfast in faith in Jesus?

If, just for today, I prayed continuously, without ceasing, would I be able to discern better the border of the world and the garden of creation?


## <a id="Three"></a>Day Three ##

> Mark 10:21 - 22 CSB
> 21Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come,  follow me.” But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.

>Exodus 16:3 - 4 CSB
>The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!” 
>4Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.

### He Loved Him and Said: ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_We live in a world full of things distributed higglety-pigglety throughout. I truly have no idea why I have what I have, why this neighbour has more of this, less of that. Why another neighbour has none._

_Thank you for giving me my manna each day. Thank you for knowing what "enough" looks like for me, and for providing that._


_Amen._

This enoughness is enough to make me feel crazy sometimes.

What is enough? Why do I have so much of some stuff and not enough of other stuff? Why do I see people without enough food, or shelter, or love in their lives? 

I sometimes reflect on those weary people wandering in the wilderness in Exodus 16 — they were right to grumble. And in response, our Lord provided exactly enough for them.

I am not sure about this, but I have a good deal of faith that if we grumble for one of us, the Lord listens and provides. Let's grumble a bit for each other and see what happens?


## <a id="Four"></a>Day Four ##
> Psalm 104:14 - 15 CSB
> 14He causes grass to grow for the livestock
>and provides crops for man to cultivate,
>producing food from the earth
>15wine that makes human hearts glad —
>making his face shine with oil —
>and bread that sustains human hearts.

### Lord My God You are Very Great ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_You wear light like a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy (Psalm 104:2)_

_You cause springs to gush into valleys (Psalm 104:10). The birds live beside the springs (Psalm 104:12). You made the moon to mark the festivals (Psalm 104:19)._

_Spending time near the stuff you created is such an important part of being human. Of being part of your creation, of dwelling on the idea that we are made in your image._

_Amen._

Noticing and indulging in all you have created is good for us.

When we allow ourselves to simply spend time dwelling in what you have created, we are closer to you. 

Looking up at the moon and remembering that You, Lord, you made that moon. You made it so that we could mark the festivals. You gave us the water we drink. You give us our food.

## <a id="Five"></a>Day Five ##

> 1John 1:1 - 4 CSB
> 1What was from the beginning,what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life —  2that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us  —  3what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.

### So Our Joy May Be Complete ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We declare to you_

_So that you may also have fellowship with us._

_So that our joy may be complete._

_Amen._

How often do I actually declare to you?

What I have seen and heard and touched — How often do I take the time to declare to you what you have created?


## <a id="Six"></a>Day Six ##

> 1John :15 - 17 CSB
> 15Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions — is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.

### Do Not Love The World ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We love you._

_We love your creation. We love the things that are part of your creation._

_Amen._

Sometimes it can feel so tiring when I am submerged in "the world".

I honestly think it's almost too much for my soul, for my brain, to try to play "whack a mole" against the "things of this world". Instead, I wonder, what about simply turning toward God, toward creation, and letting everything else fall away and slowly become unimportant?

## <a id="Seven"></a>Day Seven ##

> Ephesians 1:9 - 10 CSB
> 9 He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ 10 as a plan for the right time Or the fulfillment of times  — to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.

### As A Plan For The Right Time ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_When your child asks you for bread, you don't give him a stone. (Matthew 7:9) Right?_

_Sometimes your will is such a mystery to me. Remembering that it is a plan for the right time helps so much when I feel like I am wandering in the darkness. Thank you, Lord, for giving me bread as a plan at the right time._

_Amen._

When I am confused by what the day has presented me, I try to remember that our Father in heaven is just that: a perfect father.

And I am his small toddler-like child. Maybe to Our Father's ears, I am asking to stay up all night. Or maybe it sounds like I am asking for ice cream for breakfast and cotton candy for lunch.

Sometimes it is helpful for me to remember that, just as sometimes a good and loving parent will listen carefully to what their child wants and still help to steer them away from that thing, Our Father also does this for us because there is a plan for the right time.

## <a id="Eight"></a>Day Eight ##
> Colossians 1:15 - 17 CSB
> 15He is the image of the invisible God,
> the firstborn over all creation.
> 16For everything was created by him,
> in heaven and on earth,
> the visible and the invisible,
> whether thrones or dominions
> or rulers or authorities —
> all things have been created through him and for him.
> 17He is before all things,
> and by him all things hold together.

### By Him All Things Hold Together ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_Thank you for holding all this together._

_Amen._

I think sometimes it is easy to forget Who literally holds all this together.

## <a id="Nine"></a>Day Nine ##

> Hebrews 1:2 - 4 CSB
> 2In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him. 3The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins,  he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.  4So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.

### Superior to the Angels ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_You are the radiance of God's glory. Thank you for sustaining all things._

_Amen._

Praising, making sure we make explicit who it actually is that we worship, is something I at least need to remember to do more often.

Sometimes it takes my breath away as I say the words out loud: You are the radiance of God's glory.

Think about the last time you saw someone who looked radiant. And now realize that our Lord is radiance.

## <a id="Ten"></a>Day Ten ##
> Proverbs 8:30 -31 CSB
> 30I was a skilled craftsman beside him.
> I was his delight every day,
> always rejoicing before him.
> 31I was rejoicing in his inhabited world,
> delighting in the children of Adam.

### Wisdom and Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_Wisdom assisted You in your creative process. Lord, thank you for the gift of wisdom. Thank you for delighting in wisdom and allowing us the chance to access her._

_Amen._

Knowing that wisdom was right there, before the first soil, before the mountains, when there were no watery depths (Proverbs 8:24 - 26) fills me with awe.

This Lord we worship, wisdom is right beside him, rejoicing.

## <a id="Eleven"></a>Day Eleven ##
> Job 38:3 - 7 CSB
> 3Get ready to answer me like a man;
> when I question you, you will inform me.
> 4Where were you when I established the earth?
> Tell me, if you have understanding.
> 5Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know!
> Who stretched a measuring line across it?
> 6What supports its foundations?
> Or who laid its cornerstone
> 7while the morning stars sang together
> and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

### When You Question Me ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_You are most high. How do I have the audacity sometimes to question your power?_

_You are there when it's raining in my life. You are there, holding everything together, when I feel like I can't go on. You are the One who literally makes it rain and stops the rain. Thank you for being the creator of the universe who created me. Thank you for literally holding all this together._

_Amen._

Can you even imagine being Job? Such a loyal, faithful, good person! And still, stuff happened. Even to Job. Stuff happens. Life happens — to all of us. And the whole time stuff is happening, God is holding it all together. He literally laid the cornerstone. He's got this.

## <a id="Twelve"></a>Day Twelve ##

> Job 38:31 - 35 CSB
> 31Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades
> or loosen the belt of Orion?
> 32Can you bring out the constellations in their season
> and lead the Bear and her cubs?
> 33Do you know the laws of heaven?
> Can you impose its authority on earth?
> 34Can you command your voice to the clouds
> so that a flood of water covers you?
> 35Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go?
> Do they report to you, “Here we are”?

### They Report to You ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_Thank you for reminding me, in sometimes not so subtle ways, that you are the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings and I am your creation._

_No, I do not know the laws of heaven. I don't know how to lead bears. No, of course I can't impose the authority of the laws of heaven on earth._

_In the same way a secure toddler rests in their parents' strong loving arms, I am so glad that I can't send our lightning blots, so glad they don't report to me and say, "Here we are"._

_Amen._

Sometimes it can be so reassuring to be reminded that we are in good hands. We aren't driving this ship; we aren't in control. We have free will, sure, but ultimately, God's in control.

## <a id="Thirteen"></a>Day Thirteen ##
> Romans 5:6 - 9 CSB
> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 7For rarely will someone die for a just person — though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 8But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.
### You Died For Us ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_How can I even say, "Thank you for dying for me?"_

_Rarely will someone die for just one person. True enough. And yet you died for us, even as we were completely unaware of the need and ungrateful for the offer._

_That is a lot to take in sometimes, and I ask that I be given the grace to sit in wonder at the depth of your love for us._

_Amen._

I am in awe at the depth of the love our God has for us. Now. Always.

## <a id="Fourteen"></a>Day Fourteen ##

> Genesis 1:1 - 4 CSB
> 1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
> 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 3Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.

### In the Beginning ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_You took darkness and chaos and made it beautiful_

_You looked down on the chaos, the darkness, the formless, empty mess and saw potential._

_Thank you._

_Amen._

Even when all we can see is dark grey skies and endless night, God sees potential. God knows that light will come and it will be good.

## <a id="Fifteen"></a>Day Fifteen ##

> Genesis 2:2 - 3 CSB
> 2On the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 3God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it he rested from all his work of creation.

### You Rested ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_You are the perfect role model for us._

_You created. You completed your work and then you rested. You blessed the day you rested. You declared it holy because on it you rested._

_Amen._

We need to work. We need to complete our work. And then the holiday begins.
The holy day of rest that we need begins as soon as our work is complete. I want to live a life where I have that balance between creation and rest, work and holy resting time.

## <a id="Sixteen"></a>Day Sixteen ##
> Genesis 2:8 - 10 CSB
> 8The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed. 9The Lord God caused to grow out of the ground every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden, as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
> 10A river went from Eden to water the garden.

### You Planted a Garden ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_Thank you for creating a garden for us to live in, with everything we need._

_This world we live in has everything we need to thrive. To work, create, and rest._

_Amen._

I am so grateful when I can realize that this earth is a garden, given to us by God, with everything we need in it. We have all the stuff we need to create everything we need, including all the stuff we need to rest and have our holy days.

## <a id="Seventeen"></a>Day Seventeen ##

> 1 John 3:1 - 2 CSB
> 1See what great love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children — and we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know him. 2Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed.
> 
### We are Your Children ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_I love so much that you are the kind of God who calls us his children._

_Amen._

I am so grateful that our God is the perfect father God. Who we will be when we meet him face-to-face has not yet been revealed. But until that day, we are well cared for, adored children.

## <a id="Eighteen"></a>Day Eighteen ##


 >Jeremiah 2:13 CSB
>  For my people have committed a double evil: They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water, and dug cisterns for themselves —  cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.

### We Will Not Abandon You ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_How often do I get close to you, only to suddenly back away, perhaps out of fear of your awesomeness, and dig my own cisterns?._

_And how often do those cisterns crack and leak, spilling everywhere?_

_Thank you for always waiting patiently for me to return to you, broken cistern in hand, for you to mend it, wipe my tears, help me to take a drink from your fountain of living water?_

_Amen._

Our God is waiting so patiently for us to drink from the fountain of living water.

## <a id="Nineteen"></a>Day Nineteen ##


 >Ephesians 4:25 - 28 CSB
>  25Therefore, putting away lying, speak the truth, each one to his neighbor, because we are members of one another. 26Be angry and do not sin. Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, 27and don’t give the devil an opportunity. 28Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need.

### Speak The Truth ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_What you ask of us is so utterly human._

_You ask us to work so that we can have enough to share. You ask us to speak the truth — be angry — and take care of everything before the sun goes down._

_Thank you that you are a Father who wants us to live in the light, forthright, honest, and unafraid._

_Amen._

I think sometimes I get my Bible twisted and think that God wants me to be "nice" — But God clearly asks more from us than that. We are forthright, upstanding children who do get angry, honestly and clearly taking care of what angers us before the sun goes down. We work so that we can share with each other.

## <a id="Twenty"></a>Day Twenty ##

> Philippians 4:6
> 
> Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

### We Will Not Worry ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Through prayer and petition with thanksgiving._

_Everything — everything we will present to you._

_Amen._

It can seem overwhelming to realize that worrying is something we are actually not allowed to do as Christians. It can seem so "caring" to worry about our children, our family, our friends. And actually, it's just the opposite.
## <a id="Twentyone"></a>Day Twentyone ##

> Matthew 5:16

> In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.

### Our Light Will Shine ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for allowing our good works to shine ahead of us._

_We know we are saved by grace, but being saved is just a part of our relationship. Thank you for filling our hearts with ideas for how to work for you, for our neighbours, for this creation you have created._

_Amen._

Good works are a gift from God. Sure, we're saved by grace, but that is just the beginning of our relationship.

## <a id="Twentytwo"></a>Day Twentytwo ##

> Psalms 19:14 CSB

> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heard be acceptable to you, Lord, my rock and my Redeemer.

### My Rock ###

_Dear Lord — Great Redeemer._

_What a weighted relationship this is, Lord._

_I sit here, adored by you. You adore me. You know everyhair on my head. You knit me in my mother's womb. You know me, care for me, adore me._

_And you are my rock. You are the Redeemer. You are the Creator of the Universe._

_May my words always be acceptable to you._

_Amen._

How is it so difficult to understand that we ought to at least try to say, think, and do things that you might find favor with? 
How is it even a thing that we sometimes (I know I do!) whine and complain to you? I know — we are the children in this relationship and you patiently wait for us to better understand. 
But with that grace, maybe let us try a little harder to fathom who it is we are actually in a realtionship with?

## <a id="Twentythree"></a>Day Twentythree ##

> Psalms 139:13 - 14 CSB

> 13 For it was you who created my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother's womb. 14 I will praise you because I have been remarkable and wonderously made. Your works are wondrous, and I know this very well.

### You Know Me ###

_Dear Lord — Creator, Abba._

_You know me so well. You made me so well._

_You took such care with me, with all of us. This creation, it's all wondrous._

_Thank you for taking such care, for  being the God you are._

_Amen._

We are so blessed to have been created with such care by a God whose works are wondrous.
## <a id="Twentyfour"></a>Day Twentyfour ##

> Deuteronomy 6:12 CSB

> 12 ...be careful not to forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.

### Unforgetable ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_How powerful you are. And how gentle with us._

_I find it unimaginable sometimes, as a parent myself, that you really are this strong and caring._

_Thank you for helping me to never forget you and what you have done for us, what you will continue to do for us. And that what you ask of us is so important and doable._

_Amen._

When I commune with God the Father through Jesus, I  am often in awe of the love and strength and gentleness and power.
That combination defies human language, I think. It defies human expression. One day we will meet Him face-to-face and we will understand it. Until then, we really do need an element of pure obedience sometimes. There is no way we can fully understand a Father who loves his creation so much and is so powerful. And yet it is true. Let our hearts be as aligned as possible with His will. 
## <a id="Twentyfive"></a>Day Twentyfive ##

> Deuteronomy 6:12 CSB

> 21Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.

### Vengance is Yours ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_You are a good father. Vengance is yours, not mine.._

_So thank you for helping me feed my enemy and give him something to drink._

_Amen._

Holding the idea that God is both the best parent that ever existed with the fact that He also created the universe is challenging.
But then, leaning into that image of the most gentle and most powerful Creator, I can relax and simply do my one job of loving my neighbour. 

## <a id="Twentysix"></a>Day Twentysix ##

> 1 Timothy 6:20 - 21 CSB

> 20Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding irreverent and empty speech and contradictions from what is falsely called knowledge. 21By professing it, some people have departed from the faith.

### Knowledge ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_You are the Alpha and the Omega. You never change._

_Amen._

Reading the entire chapter of 1 Timothy 6 reminds me of that wisdom that You never change. I don't fully understand the way this chapter is written — I struggle with it. I can see how people could twist these words and encourage very poor people to stay poor while rich people enjoy abundance. I struggle wondering why you would write this chapter in this way, which might cause people to stumble.
But what I do know is that You never change. You are perfect. You are Love. The arc of Your story is not for us to horde what we have, but the contrary. Share generously is the theme. And for poor people, certainly, serve generously. Be careful with knowledge and love wisdom. 

## <a id="Twentyseven"></a>Day Twentyseven ##

> 1 John 2:3 - 5, 15 - 17, 28 - 29  CSB

> 3This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commands.The one who says, “I have come to know him,” and yet doesn’t keep his commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete. This is how we know we are in him:The one who says he remains in him should walk just as he walked. ... 15Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions — is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever. ... 28So now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.If you know that he is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

### WWJD ###

_Dear Lord — Prince of Peace, Wonderful Counselor._

_Thank you for giving me the perfect role model._

_Amen._

 Why did that saying WWJD get co-opted? It's literally all we need to do — especially when we are feeling lost. On those days where we aren't sure if we know God, when we aren't sure if we "love the world" when we aren't sure if we will be ashamed before God when we meet face-to-face. We have a perfect role model. No, we'll never be able to perfectly emmulate Jesus — but that is such a stumbling block. Whenever we are unsure, we know it is time to stop, read the Gospels a bit, and contemplate in all seriousness — what did Jesus do? What would Jesus do in this moment. And if, knowing the answer, we do not follow, we need to repent — literally turn back toward God — and keep going.

> Luke 6:43 - 45  CSB

>43 “A good tree doesn’t produce bad fruit; on the other hand, a bad tree doesn’t produce good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs aren’t gathered from thornbushes, or grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45A good person produces good out of the good stored up in his heart. An evil person produces evil out of the evil stored up in his heart, for his mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.

### Fruit ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for this warning. Remain in You. Remain in You and fruits of the spirit grow in our hearts and spill from our mouths._

_Amen._

 This morning feels tired and afraid. I suppose that feeling a farmer, or soldier, or athlete feels after a grueling stint.
 I am most familiar with the athlete's heart — so that feeling, post euphoria, when your whole body is spent. Empty, like you have just poured everything out and have nothing left.
 And so I meditate on these words now: I am a branch on a Vine and have perhaps just gone through that stage where all my resources were focused on producing a flower that will turn into a fruit. And I am exhausted. And I know that when I remain in God, remain in Jesus, rest in His word, the fruit will be good.

>18Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth.
> 19This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and will reassure our hearts before him 20whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things.
> 21Dear friends, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have confidence before God 22and receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight. 23Now this is his command: that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another as he commanded us. 24The one who keeps his commands remains in him, and he in him. And the way we know that he remains in us is from the Spirit he has given us.

### You Are Greater Than Our Hearts ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Action. You require us to love one another, not tell one another that we love them. Thank you for being stronger than my heart, for reminding me to love, not talk about love._

_Amen._

 The challenge of loving and remaining in truth is really enough to ask of us. It is our one commandment. It's enough. Remain in love. Remain in truth.

## <a id="Thirty"></a>Day Thirty ##

> James 1:2 - 8  CSB

2Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials, 3because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
5Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God — who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly — and it will be given to him. 6But let him ask in faith without doubting.1:6 Or without divided loyalties For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind. 7That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord, 8being double-minded and unstable in all his ways.

### You Fortify Us With Wisdom ###

_Dear Lord — Abba, Wonderful Counselor._

_Thank you for your unchanging, perfect, patient way. Thank you for your steady, unfailing strong and gentle light. Thank you for keeping your arms open for me to turn toward, even when I am so ashamed and weak that the idea of turning to you to ask for wisdom feels like the last thing I might be able to do. Thank you for being a God, an all-powerful God who is so gentle and patient that I can easily ask you for wisdom as I turn toward you (again)._

_Amen._

Today I was deeply struck by the quick reminder that we can ask our Abba in heaven for wisdom if we lack wisdom...if, perhaps, during a tribulation, we find ourselves utterly lost. Which, let's be honest, happens often with me :) And how often do I then flounder, feeling like I should be able to "figure things out" or know what to do? There is no shame - none - in asking Abba for wisdom - seeking Him first.

Yet you ask, “How can we return?”

### How Can We Return To You? ###

_Dear Lord — Abba, Wonderful Counselor._

_You clearly ask us to give one tenth of what we have to Your work, which you clearly define as the stuff that is not "of the world" We need to give to those who are fatherless (or maybe wew could say rootedless, without a loving and nurturing family structure) those who are widows (or, again, outside society's rootedness, structure, nurturing) the hired workers, the immigrants and refugees._

_Thank you for your clarity._


_Amen._

This morning I have been struck by how very clear the Bible is sometimes :). During this devotional series, I have been reading the entire chapter that the verses I share and meditate on are in. Sometimes I go into Logos and clarify words or find the historical context a verse appears in. What I am noticing is that the Bible is both a deep book of Wisdom and also quite clear.
We need to be giving a full tenth of what we have to those who are oppressed. We need to rely fully on God and not on any kind of sorcery or idolatry (literally, rely on God). We need to be true to our word. 
Yes, that is really, really, really hard to do.

_Thank you for staying by our side as we figure this out, in our own way, in our own time._

_Amen._

This morning my heart wants God to just tell me what to do! I read this chapter over and over again, looking up the Hebrew, reading different translations, confused. As I meditated on the words, my heart shifted. None of us is perfect, there is no one way to follow Christ faithfully. It's what makes our faith so beautiful and sometimes frustrating and confusing. That CS Lewis essay comes to mind: Where he goes to church and notices all sorts of people sitting among him — that odd grocer, etc.
Let's be workers with eachother for their joy.

_Amen._

"The more conscious I am of the work God has yet to do in me, the less critical I am about what He has yet to do in you." — Andy Stanley My devotional this morning began with this quote.
The more we turn toward you, the more we both realize what we need to do to grow and the less we need to micromanage those around us. We can joyfully partner with them but let go of the micromanaging.

They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable crown. 26So I do not run like one who runs aimlessly or box like one beating the air. 


### Self Control for Freedom ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Wonderful Counselor._

_Thank you for patiently giving us examples of how we can life free and disciplined._

_Amen._

It's a thing I find really challenging sometimes: This idea that we have freedom in Christ and we need discipline.
The analogy to running is so helpful for me at least because it's true: running is one of the freest feelings and also, in order to get to that freedom, you need to train hard and have quite a lot of self control and discipline.

### Heart & Soul ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for collaborating with us._

_Amen._

I mean that — "Thank you for collaborating with us" but honestly, some days I feel so tired, weak, and helpless that I *wish* we had a God who would just tell us exactly what to do and how.
The responsibility of being made in His image, of having a God that happily delegates to us, of needing to be in close relationship with Him sometimes feels like a burden...
And then I remember Jesus. It's not easy, but the gift of having a God who cares enough to help us grow is overwhlemingly good.

### Pride goeth before the fall ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Creator._

_You create the equation that leads to close relationship with you._

_Amen._

Honestly, It's not an easy equation to follow. As soon as I am successful, I can easily turn to pride. Too much pride, and "boom!" down I fall. Ouch.
I get up, brush myself off, turn back to God — and begin again...

### Persecution? ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for providing us with all we need for a close relationship with you._

_Amen._

I can't see verses like this without being reminded of the need for a close relationship with God. Yes, blessed are the persecuted...but no, being a martyr is not healthy. That balance, that edge, is defined in a healthy close relationship with God. We are loved, we are made in God's image. Jesus is a perfect template when we are confused about next steps to take.

_Amen._

We just finished studying other near eastern ancient cosmologies (a really really quick overview) but what was really apparent was the power in our God without violence. 
Certainly, this is a deep and perhaps controversial topic, but in my view, we have a God who shows us again and again how to be powerful without violence.

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for caring enough to allow me to grow._

_Amen._

This is such a challenging one. I mean - in no way should we be false martyrs, with a kind of "woe is I" fasle modesty / false humilty. I guess the key word is "false" isn't it?

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you. Just thank you for creating us in your image, for wanting to partner with us, collaborate with us. Thank you for providing us with all we need to rise up to the level of responsibility and obligation that you require from us._

_Amen._

Wow. I have been sitting all day today in the awareness that God is love, God created us in His image, and God wants to partner with us to create a world where heaven and earth unite. The responsibility this requires feels a bit overwhelming. And yet, full circle: We have God, literally GOD by our side, gently whispering encouragement in our ears. We can do this.

Daniel chapter 7 is a weird chapter. But in context, and seen through the lens of ancient Hebrew literature, it's gorgeous. Jesus came, He has dominion, we should serve him. It's a kind of service that brings joy and freedom. Beauty out of chaos.

> 11Everyone who knew him previously and saw him prophesy with the prophets asked each other, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
> 12Then a man who was from there asked, “And who is their father?” 
> As a result, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” became a popular saying. 13Then Saul finished prophesying and went to the high place.

###You Change Us ###

_Dear Lord — Abba, Creator._

_You change our hearts and we still cannot believe._

_Amen._

This chapter in 1 Samuel has been on my heart. There is, like a lot of Bible readings, both a chance for great hope and a lot of despair or sadness.
Saul's heart was changed by God. People thought he had become a prophet. And still, still, when Saul's uncle asked him what had happened, he said nothing about the kingship. I wonder, had he been able to be the confident king that God perhaps hoped for, the kind of king that would be deeply humble to God but also rise to the blessing and lead his people to God...I wonder.

_Thank you forloving us. So much that we know that you never abandon us, never loose hope in us._

_Amen._

Reading through God's response to Cain is such an excellent lesson in powerful love. God doesn't carelessly let Cain off the hook - nor does he rage at Cain, punishing him violently. He stays with Cain, allows Cain the chance to stand upright and confess. He still stays with Cain when Cain doesn't do that, and tells him, stright, what he has done and what the consequence will be. But never does God "lose it" or walk away. Honestly, this has me enthralled. This is our God.

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe._

_Thank you for your wisdom books and thank you for allowing us a glimpse at your wisdom._

_Amen._

Job, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs confound me. Of all of them, Job has always been a favorite. I love reading about Job's faith — it's not blind, it's not calm. I have always been drawn to how Job relates to God — he calls out, he laments, he ultimately asks God to come down and explain himself...which God does. 
And although the explanation God gives is obscure — this happened because...you can't understand? It's in a way satsifying. We really do not know the entire workings of creation. We do not know everything and so our ultimate faith in God should not be based on "good days" or "bad days" .

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_Thank you reminding us that in you we walk in the light — which means that we see clearly and that all our sin is exposed._

_Amen._

This chapter in John fills me with awe — we have this opportunity to continue in Jesus' word and when we do, we might walk in the light, and be free. Free to perhaps have the insight to see sin before we fall for it? Reflecting this morning, I read "light" in the sense that it illuminates our shadows for us so that we might do the right thing with clarity.

My life took quite a turn. I needed to pause my daily devotion and quickly had such gratitude for the decision I made to simply number my entries, not date them :)
In the interim, I have taken several courses through the BibleProject Classroom, including many where I have learned who Yahweh says He is. Not in a way that is prescriptive, but rather in a way that has allowed me to contemplate this God we believe in. I am very grateful. Life throws us curveballs, but God is steady throughout. Stay faithful.
