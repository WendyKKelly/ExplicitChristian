## <a id="One"></a>Day One ##


> John 15:5 CSB
> 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.

### In Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_As I turn toward you this morning, I am aware of both your blinding light and your intense warmth. Both fill me with respect and a sense of safety. I know I am where I am supposed to be._

_A branch on your vine. In your garden._

_Today, let me remember both the obligation and rewards of this placement. When unhelpful, toxic thoughts enter my being, thank you for letting them pass through without taking root. When I notice your sunlight on my face, thank you for gently helping me to turn more fully toward you._

_Amen._

Sometimes the best looking stuff can be the most toxic. "I was only trying to help." Anyone? 

Me, a lot, I think, if I am honest. And yet, like Judas when he tried to persuade Jesus to think that Mary was being wasteful...

What does my heart look like in those moments when I am "helping"? Often, if I am honest, I am full of fear or self serving feelings (that thing where I know what is best for someone, even before I have listened to them).

## <a id="Two"></a>Day Two ##


> Colossians 1:21 - 23 CSB
> 21Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. 22But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him  —  23if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard.

### I Live in Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_I notice that you created all things, through you and for you (Colossians 1:16)._

_You created me and now I live in your garden. In the world, but not of the world (John 17:14 - 15)._

_Today, I live in your garden. Grounded and steadfast in faith in you._

_Amen._

That idea of living in the world but not of the world is a sticky one sometimes.

Maybe it is a mindset, a way of staying grounded and steadfast in faith in Jesus?

If, just for today, I prayed continuously, without ceasing, would I be able to discern better the border of the world and the garden of creation?


## <a id="Three"></a>Day Three ##

> Mark 10:21 - 22 CSB
> 21Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come,  follow me.” But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.

>Exodus 16:3 - 4 CSB
>The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!” 
>4Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.

### He Loved Him and Said: ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_We live in a world full of things distributed higglety-pigglety throughout. I truly have no idea why I have what I have, why this neighbour has more of this, less of that. Why another neighbour has none._

_Thank you for giving me my manna each day. Thank you for knowing what "enough" looks like for me, and for providing that._


_Amen._

This enoughness is enough to make me feel crazy sometimes.

What is enough? Why do I have so much of some stuff and not enough of other stuff? Why do I see people without enough food, or shelter, or love in their lives? 

I sometimes reflect on those weary people wandering in the wilderness in Exodus 16 — they were right to grumble. And in response, our Lord provided exactly enough for them.

I am not sure about this, but I have a good deal of faith that if we grumble for one of us, the Lord listens and provides. Let's grumble a bit for each other and see what happens?


## <a id="Four"></a>Day Four ##
> Psalm 104:14 - 15 CSB
> 14He causes grass to grow for the livestock
>and provides crops for man to cultivate,
>producing food from the earth
>15wine that makes human hearts glad —
>making his face shine with oil —
>and bread that sustains human hearts.

### Lord My God You are Very Great ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_You wear light like a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy (Psalm 104:2)_

_You cause springs to gush into valleys (Psalm 104:10). The birds live beside the springs (Psalm 104:12). You made the moon to mark the festivals (Psalm 104:19)._

_Spending time near the stuff you created is such an important part of being human. Of being part of your creation, of dwelling on the idea that we are made in your image._

_Amen._

Noticing and indulging in all you have created is good for us.

When we allow ourselves to simply spend time dwelling in what you have created, we are closer to you. 

Looking up at the moon and remembering that You, Lord, you made that moon. You made it so that we could mark the festivals. You gave us the water we drink. You give us our food.

## <a id="Five"></a>Day Five ##

> 1John 1:1 - 4 CSB
> 1What was from the beginning,what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life —  2that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us  —  3what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.

### So Our Joy May Be Complete ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We declare to you_

_So that you may also have fellowship with us._

_So that our joy may be complete._

_Amen._

How often do I actually declare to you?

What I have seen and heard and touched — How often do I take the time to declare to you what you have created?


## <a id="Six"></a>Day Six ##

> 1John :15 - 17 CSB
> 15Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions — is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.

### Do Not Love The World ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We love you._

_We love your creation. We love the things that are part of your creation._

_Amen._

Sometimes it can feel so tiring when I am submerged in "the world".

I honestly think it's almost too much for my soul, for my brain, to try to play "whack a mole" against the "things of this world". Instead, I wonder, what about simply turning toward God, toward creation, and letting everything else fall away and slowly become unimportant?

## <a id="Seven"></a>Day Seven ##

> Ephesians 1:9 - 10 CSB
> 9 He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ 10 as a plan for the right time Or the fulfillment of times  — to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.

### As A Plan For The Right Time ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_When your child asks you for bread, you don't give him a stone. (Matthew 7:9) Right?_

_Sometimes your will is such a mystery to me. Remembering that it is a plan for the right time helps so much when I feel like I am wandering in the darkness. Thank you, Lord, for giving me bread as a plan at the right time._

_Amen._

When I am confused by what the day has presented me, I try to remember that our Father in heaven is just that: a perfect father.

And I am his small toddler-like child. Maybe to Our Father's ears, I am asking to stay up all night. Or maybe it sounds like I am asking for ice cream for breakfast and cotton candy for lunch.

Sometimes it is helpful for me to remember that, just as sometimes a good and loving parent will listen carefully to what their child wants and still help to steer them away from that thing, Our Father also does this for us because there is a plan for the right time.

## <a id="Eight"></a>Day Eight ##
> Colossians 1:15 - 17 CSB
> 15He is the image of the invisible God,
> the firstborn over all creation.
> 16For everything was created by him,
> in heaven and on earth,
> the visible and the invisible,
> whether thrones or dominions
> or rulers or authorities —
> all things have been created through him and for him.
> 17He is before all things,
> and by him all things hold together.

### By Him All Things Hold Together ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_Thank you for holding all this together._

_Amen._

I think sometimes it is easy to forget Who literally holds all this together.

## <a id="Nine"></a>Day Nine ##

> Hebrews 1:2 - 4 CSB
> 2In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him. 3The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins,  he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.  4So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.

### Superior to the Angels ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_You are the radiance of God's glory. Thank you for sustaining all things._

_Amen._

Praising, making sure we make explicit who it actually is that we worship, is something I at least need to remember to do more often.

Sometimes it takes my breath away as I say the words out loud: You are the radiance of God's glory.

Think about the last time you saw someone who looked radiant. And now realize that our Lord is radiance.

## <a id="Ten"></a>Day Ten ##
> Proverbs 8:30 -31 CSB
> 30I was a skilled craftsman beside him.
> I was his delight every day,
> always rejoicing before him.
> 31I was rejoicing in his inhabited world,
> delighting in the children of Adam.

### Wisdom and Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_Wisdom assisted You in your creative process. Lord, thank you for the gift of wisdom. Thank you for delighting in wisdom and allowing us the chance to access her._

_Amen._

Knowing that wisdom was right there, before the first soil, before the mountains, when there were no watery depths (Proverbs 8:24 - 26) fills me with awe.

This Lord we worship, wisdom is right beside him, rejoicing.

## <a id="Eleven"></a>Day Eleven ##
> Job 38:3 - 7 CSB
> 3Get ready to answer me like a man;
> when I question you, you will inform me.
> 4Where were you when I established the earth?
> Tell me, if you have understanding.
> 5Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know!
> Who stretched a measuring line across it?
> 6What supports its foundations?
> Or who laid its cornerstone
> 7while the morning stars sang together
> and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

### When You Question Me ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_You are most high. How do I have the audacity sometimes to question your power?_

_You are there when it's raining in my life. You are there, holding everything together, when I feel like I can't go on. You are the One who literally makes it rain and stops the rain. Thank you for being the creator of the universe who created me. Thank you for literally holding all this together._

_Amen._

Can you even imagine being Job? Such a loyal, faithful, good person! And still, stuff happened. Even to Job. Stuff happens. Life happens — to all of us. And the whole time stuff is happening, God is holding it all together. He literally laid the cornerstone. He's got this.

## <a id="Twelve"></a>Day Twelve ##

> Job 38:31 - 35 CSB
> 31Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades
> or loosen the belt of Orion?
> 32Can you bring out the constellations in their season
> and lead the Bear and her cubs?
> 33Do you know the laws of heaven?
> Can you impose its authority on earth?
> 34Can you command your voice to the clouds
> so that a flood of water covers you?
> 35Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go?
> Do they report to you, “Here we are”?

### They Report to You ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_Thank you for reminding me, in sometimes not so subtle ways, that you are the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings and I am your creation._

_No, I do not know the laws of heaven. I don't know how to lead bears. No, of course I can't impose the authority of the laws of heaven on earth._

_In the same way a secure toddler rests in their parents' strong loving arms, I am so glad that I can't send our lightning blots, so glad they don't report to me and say, "Here we are"._

_Amen._

Sometimes it can be so reassuring to be reminded that we are in good hands. We aren't driving this ship; we aren't in control. We have free will, sure, but ultimately, God's in control.

## <a id="Thirteen"></a>Day Thirteen ##
> Romans 5:6 - 9 CSB
> For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. 7For rarely will someone die for a just person — though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 8But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.
### You Died For Us ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings, Prince of Peace._

_How can I even say, "Thank you for dying for me?"_

_Rarely will someone die for just one person. True enough. And yet you died for us, even as we were completely unaware of the need and ungrateful for the offer._

_That is a lot to take in sometimes, and I ask that I be given the grace to sit in wonder at the depth of your love for us._

_Amen._

I am in awe at the depth of the love our God has for us. Now. Always.

## <a id="Fourteen"></a>Day Fourteen ##

> Genesis 1:1 - 4 CSB
> 1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
> 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 3Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.

### In the Beginning ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_You took darkness and chaos and made it beautiful_

_You looked down on the chaos, the darkness, the formless, empty mess and saw potential._

_Thank you._

_Amen._

Even when all we can see is dark grey skies and endless night, God sees potential. God knows that light will come and it will be good.

## <a id="Fifteen"></a>Day Fifteen ##

> Genesis 2:2 - 3 CSB
> 2On the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 3God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it he rested from all his work of creation.

### You Rested ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_You are the perfect role model for us._

_You created. You completed your work and then you rested. You blessed the day you rested. You declared it holy because on it you rested._

_Amen._

We need to work. We need to complete our work. And then the holiday begins.
The holy day of rest that we need begins as soon as our work is complete. I want to live a life where I have that balance between creation and rest, work and holy resting time.

## <a id="Sixteen"></a>Day Sixteen ##
> Genesis 2:8 - 10 CSB
> 8The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed. 9The Lord God caused to grow out of the ground every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden, as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
> 10A river went from Eden to water the garden.

### You Planted a Garden ###

_Dear Lord — Creator._

_Thank you for creating a garden for us to live in, with everything we need._

_This world we live in has everything we need to thrive. To work, create, and rest._

_Amen._

I am so grateful when I can realize that this earth is a garden, given to us by God, with everything we need in it. We have all the stuff we need to create everything we need, including all the stuff we need to rest and have our holy days.

## <a id="Seventeen"></a>Day Seventeen ##

> 1 John 3:1 - 2 CSB
> 1See what great love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children — and we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know him. 2Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed.
> 
### We are Your Children ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_I love so much that you are the kind of God who calls us his children._

_Amen._

I am so grateful that our God is the perfect father God. Who we will be when we meet him face-to-face has not yet been revealed. But until that day, we are well cared for, adored children.

## <a id="Eighteen"></a>Day Eighteen ##


 >Jeremiah 2:13 CSB
>  For my people have committed a double evil: They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water, and dug cisterns for themselves —  cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.

### We Will Not Abandon You ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_How often do I get close to you, only to suddenly back away, perhaps out of fear of your awesomeness, and dig my own cisterns?._

_And how often do those cisterns crack and leak, spilling everywhere?_

_Thank you for always waiting patiently for me to return to you, broken cistern in hand, for you to mend it, wipe my tears, help me to take a drink from your fountain of living water?_

_Amen._

Our God is waiting so patiently for us to drink from the fountain of living water.

## <a id="Nineteen"></a>Day Nineteen ##


 >Ephesians 4:25 - 28 CSB
>  25Therefore, putting away lying, speak the truth, each one to his neighbor, because we are members of one another. 26Be angry and do not sin. Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, 27and don’t give the devil an opportunity. 28Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need.

### Speak The Truth ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_What you ask of us is so utterly human._

_You ask us to work so that we can have enough to share. You ask us to speak the truth — be angry — and take care of everything before the sun goes down._

_Thank you that you are a Father who wants us to live in the light, forthright, honest, and unafraid._

_Amen._

I think sometimes I get my Bible twisted and think that God wants me to be "nice" — But God clearly asks more from us than that. We are forthright, upstanding children who do get angry, honestly and clearly taking care of what angers us before the sun goes down. We work so that we can share with each other.

## <a id="Twenty"></a>Day Twenty ##

> Philippians 4:6
> 
> Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

### We Will Not Worry ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Through prayer and petition with thanksgiving._

_Everything — everything we will present to you._

_Amen._

It can seem overwhelming to realize that worrying is something we are actually not allowed to do as Christians. It can seem so "caring" to worry about our children, our family, our friends. And actually, it's just the opposite.
## <a id="Twentyone"></a>Day Twentyone ##

> Matthew 5:16

> In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.

### Our Light Will Shine ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_Thank you for allowing our good works to shine ahead of us._

_We know we are saved by grace, but being saved is just a part of our relationship. Thank you for filling our hearts with ideas for how to work for you, for our neighbours, for this creation you have created._

_Amen._

Good works are a gift from God. Sure, we're saved by grace, but that is just the beginning of our relationship.

## <a id="Twentytwo"></a>Day Twentytwo ##

> Psalms 19:14 CSB

> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heard be acceptable to you, Lord, my rock and my Redeemer.

### My Rock ###

_Dear Lord — Great Redeemer._

_What a weighted relationship this is, Lord._

_I sit here, adored by you. You adore me. You know everyhair on my head. You knit me in my mother's womb. You know me, care for me, adore me._

_And you are my rock. You are the Redeemer. You are the Creator of the Universe._

_May my words always be acceptable to you._

_Amen._

How is it so difficult to understand that we ought to at least try to say, think, and do things that you might find favor with? 
How is it even a thing that we sometimes (I know I do!) whine and complain to you? I know — we are the children in this relationship and you patiently wait for us to better understand. 
But with that grace, maybe let us try a little harder to fathom who it is we are actually in a realtionship with?

## <a id="Twentythree"></a>Day Twentythree ##

> Psalms 139:13 - 14 CSB

> 13 For it was you who created my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother's womb. 14 I will praise you because I have been remarkable and wonderously made. Your works are wondrous, and I know this very well.

### You Know Me ###

_Dear Lord — Creator, Abba._

_You know me so well. You made me so well._

_You took such care with me, with all of us. This creation, it's all wondrous._

_Thank you for taking such care, for  being the God you are._

_Amen._

We are so blessed to have been created with such care by a God whose works are wondrous.
## <a id="Twentyfour"></a>Day Twentyfour ##

> Deuteronomy 6:12 CSB

> 12 ...be careful not to forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.

### Unforgetable ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_How powerful you are. And how gentle with us._

_I find it unimaginable sometimes, as a parent myself, that you really are this strong and caring._

_Thank you for helping me to never forget you and what you have done for us, what you will continue to do for us. And that what you ask of us is so important and doable._

_Amen._

When I commune with God the Father through Jesus, I  am often in awe of the love and strength and gentleness and power.
That combination defies human language, I think. It defies human expression. One day we will meet Him face-to-face and we will understand it. Until then, we really do need an element of pure obedience sometimes. There is no way we can fully understand a Father who loves his creation so much and is so powerful. And yet it is true. Let our hearts be as aligned as possible with His will. 
## <a id="Twentyfive"></a>Day Twentyfive ##

> Deuteronomy 6:12 CSB

> 21Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.

### Vengance is Yours ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_You are a good father. Vengance is yours, not mine.._

_So thank you for helping me feed my enemy and give him something to drink._

_Amen._

Holding the idea that God is both the best parent that ever existed with the fact that He also created the universe is challenging.
But then, leaning into that image of the most gentle and most powerful Creator, I can relax and simply do my one job of loving my neighbour. 

## <a id="Twentysix"></a>Day Twentysix ##

> 1 Timothy 6:20 - 21 CSB

> 20Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding irreverent and empty speech and contradictions from what is falsely called knowledge. 21By professing it, some people have departed from the faith.

### Knowledge ###

_Dear Lord — King of Kings._

_You are the Alpha and the Omega. You never change._

_Amen._

Reading the entire chapter of 1 Timothy 6 reminds me of that wisdom that You never change. I don't fully understand the way this chapter is written — I struggle with it. I can see how people could twist these words and encourage very poor people to stay poor while rich people enjoy abundance. I struggle wondering why you would write this chapter in this way, which might cause people to stumble.
But what I do know is that You never change. You are perfect. You are Love. The arc of Your story is not for us to horde what we have, but the contrary. Share generously is the theme. And for poor people, certainly, serve generously. Be careful with knowledge and love wisdom. 

## <a id="Twentyseven"></a>Day Twentyseven ##

> 1 John 2:3 - 5, 15 - 17, 28 - 29  CSB

> 3This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commands.The one who says, “I have come to know him,” and yet doesn’t keep his commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete. This is how we know we are in him:The one who says he remains in him should walk just as he walked. ... 15Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions — is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever. ... 28So now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.If you know that he is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

### WWJD ###

_Dear Lord — Prince of Peace, Wonderful Counselor._

_Thank you for giving me the perfect role model._

_Amen._

 Why did that saying WWJD get co-opted? It's literally all we need to do — especially when we are feeling lost. On those days where we aren't sure if we know God, when we aren't sure if we "love the world" when we aren't sure if we will be ashamed before God when we meet face-to-face. We have a perfect role model. No, we'll never be able to perfectly emmulate Jesus — but that is such a stumbling block. Whenever we are unsure, we know it is time to stop, read the Gospels a bit, and contemplate in all seriousness — what did Jesus do? What would Jesus do in this moment. And if, knowing the answer, we do not follow, we need to repent — literally turn back toward God — and keep going.
