## <a id="One"></a>Day One ##


> John 15:5 CSB
> 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.

### In Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_As I turn toward you this morning, I am aware of both your blinding light and your intense warmth. Both fill me with respect and a sense of safety. I know I am where I am supposed to be._

_A branch on your vine. In your garden._

_Today, let me remember both the obligation and rewards of this placement. When unhelpful, toxic thoughts enter my being, thank you for letting them pass through without taking root. When I notice your sunlight on my face, thank you for gently helping me to turn more fully toward you._

_Amen._

Sometimes the best looking stuff can be the most toxic. "I was only trying to help." Anyone? 

Me, a lot, I think, if I am honest. And yet, like Judas when he tried to persuade Jesus to think that Mary was being wasteful...

What does my heart look like in those moments when I am "helping"? Often, if I am honest, I am full of fear or self serving feelings (that thing where I know what is best for someone, even before I have listened to them).

## <a id="Two"></a>Day Two ##


> Colossians 1:21 - 23 CSB
> 21Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. 22But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him  —  23if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard.

### I Live in Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_I notice that you created all things, through you and for you (Colossians 1:16)._

_You created me and now I live in your garden. In the world, but not of the world (John 17:14 - 15)._

_Today, I live in your garden. Grounded and steadfast in faith in you._

_Amen._

That idea of living in the world but not of the world is a sticky one sometimes.

Maybe it is a mindset, a way of staying grounded and steadfast in faith in Jesus?

If, just for today, I prayed continuously, without ceasing, would I be able to discern better the border of the world and the garden of creation?


## <a id="Three"></a>Day Three ##

> Mark 10:21 - 22 CSB
> 21Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come,  follow me.” But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.

>Exodus 16:3 - 4 CSB
>The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!” 
>4Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.

### He Loved Him and Said: ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_We live in a world full of things distributed higglety-pigglety throughout. I truly have no idea why I have what I have, why this neighbour has more of this, less of that. Why another neighbour has none._

_Thank you for giving me my manna each day. Thank you for knowing what "enough" looks like for me, and for providing that._


_Amen._

This enoughness is enough to make me feel crazy sometimes.

What is enough? Why do I have so much of some stuff and not enough of other stuff? Why do I see people without enough food, or shelter, or love in their lives? 

I sometimes reflect on those weary people wandering in the wilderness in Exodus 16 — they were right to grumble. And in response, our Lord provided exactly enough for them.

I am not sure about this, but I have a good deal of faith that if we grumble for one of us, the Lord listens and provides. Let's grumble a bit for each other and see what happens?
