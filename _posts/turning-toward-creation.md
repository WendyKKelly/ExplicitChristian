> John 15:5 CSB
> 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me.

### In Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_As I turn toward you this morning, I am aware of both your blinding light and your intense warmth. Both fill me with respect and a sense of safety. I know I am where I am supposed to be._

_A branch on your vine. In your garden._

_Today, let me remember both the obligation and rewards of this placement. When unhelpful, toxic thoughts enter my being, thank you for letting them pass through without taking root. When I notice your sunlight on my face, thank you for gently helping me to turn more fully toward you._

_Amen._

Sometimes the best looking stuff can be the most toxic. "I was only trying to help." Anyone? 

Me, a lot, I think, if I am honest. And yet, like Judas when he tried to persuade Jesus to think that Mary was being wasteful...

What does my heart look like in those moments when I am "helping"? Often, if I am honest, I am full of fear or self serving feelings (that thing where I know what is best for someone, even before I have listened to them).

## <a id="Two"></a>Day Two ##


> Colossians 1:21 - 23 CSB
> 21Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. 22But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him  —  23if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard.

### I Live in Creation ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace, Great Redeemer._

_I notice that you created all things, through you and for you (Colossians 1:16)._

_You created me and now I live in your garden. In the world, but not of the world (John 17:14 - 15)._

_Today, I live in your garden. Grounded and steadfast in faith in you._

_Amen._

That idea of living in the world but not of the world is a sticky one sometimes.

Maybe it is a mindset, a way of staying grounded and steadfast in faith in Jesus?

If, just for today, I prayed continuously, without ceasing, would I be able to discern better the border of the world and the garden of creation?


## <a id="Three"></a>Day Three ##

> Mark 10:21 - 22 CSB
> 21Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come,  follow me.” But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.

>Exodus 16:3 - 4 CSB
>The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!” 
>4Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.

### He Loved Him and Said: ###

_Dear Lord — Abba._

_We live in a world full of things distributed higglety-pigglety throughout. I truly have no idea why I have what I have, why this neighbour has more of this, less of that. Why another neighbour has none._

_Thank you for giving me my manna each day. Thank you for knowing what "enough" looks like for me, and for providing that._


_Amen._

This enoughness is enough to make me feel crazy sometimes.

What is enough? Why do I have so much of some stuff and not enough of other stuff? Why do I see people without enough food, or shelter, or love in their lives? 

I sometimes reflect on those weary people wandering in the wilderness in Exodus 16 — they were right to grumble. And in response, our Lord provided exactly enough for them.

I am not sure about this, but I have a good deal of faith that if we grumble for one of us, the Lord listens and provides. Let's grumble a bit for each other and see what happens?


## <a id="Four"></a>Day Four ##
> Psalm 104:14 - 15 CSB
> 14He causes grass to grow for the livestock
>and provides crops for man to cultivate,
>producing food from the earth
>15wine that makes human hearts glad —
>making his face shine with oil —
>and bread that sustains human hearts.

### Lord My God You are Very Great ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_You wear light like a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy (Psalm 104:2)_

_You cause springs to gush into valleys (Psalm 104:10). The birds live beside the springs (Psalm 104:12). You made the moon to mark the festivals (Psalm 104:19)._

_Spending time near the stuff you created is such an important part of being human. Of being part of your creation, of dwelling on the idea that we are made in your image._

_Amen._

Noticing and indulging in all you have created is good for us.

When we allow ourselves to simply spend time dwelling in what you have created, we are closer to you. 

Looking up at the moon and remembering that You, Lord, you made that moon. You made it so that we could mark the festivals. You gave us the water we drink. You give us our food.

## <a id="Five"></a>Day Five ##

> 1John 1:1 - 4 CSB
> 1What was from the beginning,what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life —  2that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us  —  3what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.

### So Our Joy May Be Complete ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We declare to you_

_So that you may also have fellowship with us._

_So that our joy may be complete._

_Amen._

How often do I actually declare to you?

What I have seen and heard and touched — How often do I take the time to declare to you what you have created?


## <a id="Six"></a>Day Six ##

> 1John :15 - 17 CSB
> 15Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions — is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.

### Do Not Love The World ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_We love you._

_We love your creation. We love the things that are part of your creation._

_Amen._

Sometimes it can feel so tiring when I am submerged in "the world".

I honestly think it's almost too much for my soul, for my brain, to try to play "whack a mole" against the "things of this world". Instead, I wonder, what about simply turning toward God, toward creation, and letting everything else fall away and slowly become unimportant?

## <a id="Seven"></a>Day Seven ##

> Ephesians 1:9 - 10 CSB
> 9 He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he purposed in Christ 10 as a plan for the right time Or the fulfillment of times  — to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him.

### As A Plan For The Right Time ###

_Dear Lord — Creator of the Universe, Author of the Laws of the Universe._

_When your child asks you for bread, you don't give him a stone. (Matthew 7:9) Right?_

_Sometimes your will is such a mystery to me. Remembering that it is a plan for the right time helps so much when I feel like I am wandering in the darkness. Thank you, Lord, for giving me bread as a plan at the right time._

_Amen._

When I am confused by what the day has presented me, I try to remember that our Father in heaven is just that: a perfect father.

And I am his small toddler-like child. Maybe to Our Father's ears, I am asking to stay up all night. Or maybe it sounds like I am asking for ice cream for breakfast and cotton candy for lunch.

Sometimes it is helpful for me to remember that, just as sometimes a good and loving parent will listen carefully to what their child wants and still help to steer them away from that thing, Our Father also does this for us because there is a plan for the right time.

## <a id="Eight"></a>Day Eight ##
> Colossians 1:15 - 17 CSB
> 15He is the image of the invisible God,
> the firstborn over all creation.
> 16For everything was created by him,
> in heaven and on earth,
> the visible and the invisible,
> whether thrones or dominions
> or rulers or authorities —
> all things have been created through him and for him.
> 17He is before all things,
> and by him all things hold together.

### By Him All Things Hold Together ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_Thank you for holding all this together._

_Amen._

I think sometimes it is easy to forget Who literally holds all this together.

## <a id="Nine"></a>Day Nine ##

> Hebrews 1:2 - 4 CSB
> 2In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him. 3The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins,  he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.  4So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.

### Superior to the Angels ###

_Dear Lord — Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace._

_You are the radiance of God's glory. Thank you for sustaining all things._

_Amen._

I think sometimes it is easy to forget Who literally holds all this together.
